        "All of these classes can be initialized in a simple and unified way from pretrained instances by using a common from_pretrained() method which downloads (if needed), caches and loads the related class instance and associated data (configurations’ hyperparameters, tokenizers’ vocabulary, and models’ weights) from a pretrained checkpoint provided on Hugging Face Hub or your own saved checkpoint.\n",
        "On top of those three base classes, the library provides two APIs: pipeline() for quickly using a model for inference on a given task and Trainer to quickly train or fine-tune a PyTorch model (all TensorFlow models are compatible with Keras.fit).\n",
        "As a consequence, this library is NOT a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. If you want to extend or build upon the library, just use regular Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras modules and inherit from the base classes of the library to reuse functionalities like model loading and saving.
